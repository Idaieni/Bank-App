# Bank-App
CS 210 Bank App project
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
It was solving the issue a bank had with helping customers figure out their takebacks from a saviongs account with interest. 
What did you do particularly well?
I actually was able to code the project to not quit after the first attempt to enter input I have struggled with my projects crashing or quiting after the first input is entered.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the code to accept multiple inputs from the customer to look at different types of savings or interest bearing accounts. This wouldn't make it more secure but it might be something the customer wanted. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the whole program challenging because I am not adept in C++ and it is a very confusing language for me. I overcame this by looking at different tutorials on Codeacademy, udemy, and sololearner.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
It has helped me be more efficient in python by allowing me to learn different actions that I could transfer over to my python skills.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used as few lines of code as a I could to make the program maintainable and readable by other people, I made it adaptable so I could go back and tinker with it once it was finished to see if I could add more input schematics to find other savings accounts.
